# Dice-roller-program
The user is allowed to choose the number of dice.
If the user enters an invalid value, the block of code in the While function reruns.
Each dice gets a random state out of the total of 6 possible states.
All dice are printed and the total is displayed.

I wrote this script to further practice using the random module and printing ASCII art from a database.
